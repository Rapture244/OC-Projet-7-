# ==================================================================================================================== #
# [WARNING] Please note: While creating a new project on Heroku, do not enable the option for Automatic Deployments as this would result in an error when the GitHub Action is triggered.


# ======================================================= ERROR ====================================================== #
# Error 1: Inside poetry .yaml, in [tool.poetry], I forgot to add { include = "api"} so it can be treated as a module even tho I add __init__.py

# ======================================================= ERROR ====================================================== #
# Error 2: 'distutils' removed in python 3.12, to correct it --> "poetry add setuptools" which include 'distutils' for Python 3.12

# ======================================================= ERROR ====================================================== #
# Error 3: Wrong akhileshns/heroku-deploy@ tag, latest is --> 'AkhileshNS/heroku-deploy@v3.13.15'

# ======================================================= ERROR ====================================================== #
# Error 4: Multiples errors
#    - The CI/CD file inside ".github/workflows" need to be named 'main.yml' and not 'ci-cd.yml' like i did
#    - `ubuntu-latest` does not support `heroku-cli`, be sure to install it through the main.yml file

# ======================================================= ERROR ====================================================== #
# Error 5: Shap for feature importance require numba which requires llvmlite which is a "lightweight wrapper around basic LLVM functionality "
#    - The issue is that since it is run on Ubuntu, llvmlite requires llvm-config, a system wide LLVM toolchain present at build time
#    - Heroku’s default Python buildpack does not provide LLVM/clang or llvm-config. This is causing the build to fail and the deployment
# SOLUTION:
#    - Use a Aptfile with llvm-14 to be run before the Python build pack !
#    - Then 2 solution: through the local Heroku CLI or the Heroku Dashboard !
# CLI:
# 1) Clear existing buildpacks (optional, if you already have them)
# heroku buildpacks:clear --app credit-score-attribution
# 2) Add the apt buildpack first
# heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 heroku-community/apt --app credit-score-attribution
# 3) Add the Python buildpack second
# heroku buildpacks:add --index 2 heroku/python --app credit-score-attribution

# Heroku Dashboard:
#    - Go to ur app "credit-score-attribution"
#    - Click Settings → Buildpacks → Add buildpack.
#    - Select heroku-community/apt, make sure it’s the top buildpack in the list.
#    - Then add the heroku/python buildpack below it.
#    - Save the changes.

# ======================================================= ERROR ====================================================== #
# Error 6: Aptfile and multi-buildpack approach is being recognized but Heroku is running on the "Heroku-24" stack which doesnt have llvm-14
#    - Switch to a more standard release: "Heroku-22"
#
# CLi:
# heroku stack --app credit-score-attribution
# heroku stack:set heroku-22 --app credit-score-attribution

# ======================================================= ERROR ====================================================== #
# Error 7: “Push failed … The same version of this code has already been built” message.
#    - Heroku thinks you’re redeploying exactly the same commit SHA without any code changes, so it’s refusing to rebuild.
#    - This can happen if you force-push or re-run your GitHub Actions with no actual code difference.
#
#CLi: make new empty commit for new hash but it did not work
# git commit --allow-empty -m "Change for Heroku build"
#
# NO SOLUTION : Deleted old app on Heroku and remade it with all changes until now and same name

# ======================================================= ERROR ====================================================== #
# Error 8: Not setting the exact python version and some weird stuff with poetry
# SOLUTION: Setting the exact version with .python-version. Dont forget to 'poetry lock'

# ======================================================= ERROR ====================================================== #
# Error 9: Slug size exceed the 500Mb limit = final app + dependencies is too big
#
# SOLUTION 1: Add unused libraries for the production and the app to [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies] inside poetry
# SOLUTION 2: Create a .slugignore in ur repo root to  exclude certain files from the slug (similar to .gitignore)

# ======================================================= SUCCESS then ERROR ! ======================================== #
# Error 10: wrong Procfile line
# So the app was launched but from the logs my Procfile says "web: poetry run gunicorn api.local_main:app" so Heroku tries to run poetry in production but it isn't on the PATH
#
# Solution: use "web: gunicorn api.local_main:app" in Procfile, that's the standard approach

# ======================================================= ERROR  ===================================================== #
# Error 11 to 13: issues with packages and poetry. Created a 'prod' and 'dev' packages
#
# 'prod' is added though the [tool.poetry]
# 'dev' is to be ignored and thus its libraries were sent to [tool.poetry.group.dev.dependencies]
#
# After this, i still had an issue during Heroku deployment after CI/CD validation ---> siphash24  & lightgbm were required



# ==================================================================================================================== #
